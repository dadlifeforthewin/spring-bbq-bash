# Cleanup Crew Station — Design Reference

Brian-approved mobile mock captured 2026-04-20. Source screenshot was in macOS TemporaryItems and auto-purged; ask Brian to re-send if a pixel-accurate reference is needed. Written description below.

## Layout (mobile-only; `/station/cleanup`)

- `<PageHead>` — back link "← STATIONS" to `/station`, title "CLEANUP CREW", subtitle "Check items as you finish. Last person to tap 'Lock' closes out the night.", right-side `<Chip tone="gold" glow>` showing "N/M DONE" progress (e.g., "2/7 DONE").
- Hairline dashed divider under the head.
- Stacked list of pill-style task rows. Each row:
  - Left: chunky iOS-style toggle switch (track is gold when on, gray/ink-2 when off).
  - Right of toggle: uppercase display-font task label + small mist-colored sub-label for location (e.g., "FOLD & STACK TABLES" / "Main Tent").
  - Completed rows strike through the label and desaturate the toggle.
  - Border: faint ink-hair when off; mint-at-30%-opacity glow when on (visual parity with BigToggle primitive).
- Bottom sticky full-width gradient button (`CLOSE OUT (N LEFT)`): magenta→cyan gradient, disabled while `N > 0`. Tappable only when all items are toggled on.

## Behavior

- Item toggles are **always** tappable, including after close-out. Intent: someone who cleaned early can still toggle state if they miscounted, or a late volunteer can un-toggle if an item was prematurely marked.
- Close-out button is enabled only when `remaining === 0`. Tapping it POSTs a `cleanup_locked_at` timestamp on the event (single row in a `cleanup_locks` table or a column on `events`). That's it — UI affirms "Night locked", but items remain toggleable, and if any item later flips to off, `remaining` > 0 and the close-out button re-enables (tapping again writes a new `cleanup_locked_at`).
- Progress chip in the head is live-reactive to toggle state.

## Tone

- **Gold** (shares with prize_wheel — never colocated on the same page).

## Admin CRUD (`/admin/cleanup`)

- List view of cleanup tasks with: label, sub (location), sort_order, active.
- Inline reorder (drag or up/down buttons).
- Add new task / edit existing / deactivate.
- Tasks persist year over year — this is a recurring event.

## DB tables (draft)

```
cleanup_tasks
  id uuid pk
  label text not null
  sub text                       -- location / detail
  sort_order int not null default 0
  active boolean not null default true
  created_at timestamptz default now()

cleanup_completions
  id uuid pk
  task_id uuid fk cleanup_tasks
  completed_at timestamptz default now()
  completed_by text              -- volunteer name/handle
  unique (task_id)               -- one row per task; toggled off = delete row

cleanup_locks
  id uuid pk
  locked_at timestamptz default now()
  locked_by text
```

Exact schema to be finalized in Phase 5.5 Task 5.5.5 (migration).

## Seed examples (from the mock)

1. Fold & Stack Tables — Main Tent
2. Trash Bags to Dumpster — Side lot
3. Collect Lost & Found — Check-in table
4. Pull Down Signage — Gates + parking
5. Break Down Cardboard — Back of kitchen
6. Label Leftovers for Fridge — Kitchen
7. Lock Sheds + Confirm Lights — Grounds
